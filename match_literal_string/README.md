***Regular Expressions: Match Literal Strings***

In the last challenge, you searched for the word "Hello" using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string "Hello". Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string "Kevin":

```javascript
let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
```

Any other forms of "Kevin" will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match "kevin" or "KEVIN".

```javascript
let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns false
```

A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.

Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.
