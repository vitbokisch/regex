***Regular Expressions: Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times***

The last challenge used the plus + sign to look for characters that occur one or more times. There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

The character to do this is the asterisk or star: *.

```javascript
let soccerWord = "gooooooooal!";
let gPhrase = "gut feeling";
let oPhrase = "over the moon";
let goRegex = /go*/;
soccerWord.match(goRegex); // Returns ["goooooooo"]
gPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns ["g"]
oPhrase.match(goRegex); // Returns null
```

Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match all the upper and lower"a" characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags, and it should not match any of the other quotes.
