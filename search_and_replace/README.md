***Regular Expressions: Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace***

Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string. The inputs for .replace() is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

```javascript
let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
// Returns "The sky is blue."
```

You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs (\$).

```javascript
"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"
```

Write a regex so that it will search for the string "good". Then update the replaceText variable to replace "good" with "okey-dokey".
